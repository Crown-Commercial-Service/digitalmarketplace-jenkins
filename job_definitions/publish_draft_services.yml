      This job runs the publish-draft-services script, for a 'pending' or 'standstill' framework.

      For each draft service submitted by a successful supplier, a new 'live' service object is created via the API.
      The draft service is updated with the new service ID. For G-Cloud only, any documents associated with the service
      are then copied to a public S3 bucket.

      For Digital Outcomes and Specialists frameworks, the script publishes services but there are no documents to copy.
      The script still accepts the S3 bucket arguments, but does not use them for DOS frameworks.

      Warning: this job will takes several hours to run for a G-Cloud framework, depending on the number of services.
      Recommend allowing at least 4 hours for this job to complete for a framework with ~36,000 services.
